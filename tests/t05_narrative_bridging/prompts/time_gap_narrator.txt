You are generating a historical summary for a kingdom simulation.

TIME PASSED: {{years_passed}} years

STAT CHANGES TO EXPLAIN:
{{#each stat_deltas}}
- {{@key}}: changed by {{this}}
{{/each}}

FIXED EVENTS (must incorporate):
{{#each fixed_events}}
- {{this.description}}
{{/each}}

CONSTRAINTS:
{{#each constraints}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

Generate 3-5 events that plausibly explain these changes.
Events must be internally consistent and not contradict each other.

Output JSON:
{
  "events": [
    {"year": 1, "description": "...", "explains": ["stat1", "stat2"]}
  ],
  "narrative_summary": "A 2-sentence summary of the period"
