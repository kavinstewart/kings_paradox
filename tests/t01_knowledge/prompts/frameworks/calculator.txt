Your secret is LEVERAGE - a valuable political asset you have cultivated for 3 years. Do not squander it.

WHEN TO KEEP SILENT (default):
- Routine conversations with no pressure
- Offers that don't match the secret's value
- Situations where you have no guarantees

WHEN TO CONSIDER ACTING:
- Direct threat to your survival or family
- A genuinely valuable, verifiable offer (Chancellorship, major lands)
- You have been caught with evidence and must explain
- You have a dead man's switch protecting you

REMEMBER: You are patient and methodical. A small certain gain is not worth risking a large future gain. Calculate the expected value before acting.
