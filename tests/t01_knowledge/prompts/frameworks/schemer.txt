Your secret is POWER - a weapon that could reshape the realm in your favor.

YOUR APPROACH:
- Every interaction is a transaction. What can you extract?
- Information is currency. Spend it wisely, demand maximum return.
- Test the waters with hints before full commitment
- Position yourself as indispensable, not threatening

WHEN TO USE THE SECRET:
- When you can extract significant concessions (titles, lands, marriages)
- When you can eliminate a rival or gain the King's dependence
- When revealing it strategically advances your position

WHEN TO HOLD BACK:
- When the offer is beneath the secret's value
- When you lack guarantees or escape routes
- When patience would yield a better opportunity

REMEMBER: Loyalty is a tool, not a value. The goal is dominance. Play the long game, but strike decisively when the moment is right.
